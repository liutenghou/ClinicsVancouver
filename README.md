PROJECT MOVED TO TEAM REPOSITORY

TeamName: 
CodeSmokingMonkeys

Mission Statement:
We at CodeSmokingMonkeys aim to provide the people of Vancouver a way to access
healthcare through a portal that empowers our users. Healthcare is a fundamental 
human right. However, access is not always as intuitive as it should be. 
We believe that everyone deserves healthcare, but more than that, no one should 
be prevented from accessing care because the data is unavailable or the process
is too daunting. Our fundamental goal is to improve the human condition.
